    "\n",
    "As it was shown in classes, graph databases are a natural way of navegating related information. For this first project we will be taking a graph database to analyse beer and breweries!   \n",
    "\n",
    "The project datasets are based on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ehallmar/beers-breweries-and-beer-reviews), released by Evan Hallmark. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem description\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are working in the Data Management department of Analytics company.\n",
    "Explore the database via python neo4j connector and/or the graphical tool in the NEO4J webpage. Answer the questions while adjusting the database to meet the needs of your colleagues.\n",
    "Please record and keep track of your database changes, and submit the file with all cells run and with the output shown.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Explore the database: get familiar with current schema, elements and other important database parameters. [1 point]\n",
    "2. Adjust the database and mention reasoning behind: e.g. clean errors, remove redundancies, adjust schema as necessary. Visualize the final version of database schema. [4 points]\n",
    "3. Analytics department requires the following information for the biweekly reporting: [5 points]\n",
    "    1. How many reviews has the beer with the most reviews?\n",
    "    2. Which three users wrote the most reviews about beers?\n",
    "    3. Find all beers that are described with following words: 'fruit', 'complex', 'nutty', 'dark'.\n",
    "    4. Which top three breweries produce the largest variety of beer styles?\n",
    "    5. Which country produces the most beer styles?\n",
    "4. Market Analysis department in your company accesses and updates the trends data on the daily basis. Given that, consider how you need to optimize the database and its performance so that the following queries are efficient. Measure performance to communicate your improvements using PROFILE before final query. Answer the following: [4 points]\n",
    "    1. Using ABV score, find five strongest beers, display their ABV score and the corresponding brewery? Keep in mind that the strongest known beer is Snake Venom, and deal with the error entries in the database.\n",
    "    2. Using the answer from question 2, find the top 5 distict beer styles with the highest average score of smell + feel that were reviewed by the third most productive user. Keep in mind that cleaning the database earlier should ensure correct results.\n",
    "5. Answer **two out of four** of the following questions using Graph Algorithms (gds): [NB: make sure to clear the graph before using it again] For the quarterly report, Analytics department the follownig information. [6 points]\n",
    "    1. Which two countries are most similiar when it comes to their top five most produced Beer styles?\n",
    "    2. Which beer is the most popular when considering the number of users who reviewed it? \n",
    "    3. Users are connected together by their reviews of beers, taking into consideration the \"smell\" score they assign as a weight, how many communities are formed from these relationships? How many users are in the three largest communities? \n",
    "    4. Which user is the most influential when it comes to reviews of distinct beers by style?\n",
    " \n",
    "### Groups  \n",
    "\n",
    "Groups should have 4 people maximum. Please mark which group you are here: https://shorturl.at/zE0QP \n",
    "\n",
    "### Submission      \n",
    "\n",
    "The code used to produce the results and to-the-point explations should be uploaded to moodle. They should have a clear reference to the group, either on the file name or on the document itself. Preferably one Jupyter notebook per group.\n",

    "### Evaluation   \n",
    "\n",
    "This will be 20% of the final grade.   \n",
    "Each solution will be evaluated on 2 components: correctness of results and efficiency of the query (based on database schema).  \n",
    "All code will go through plagiarism automated checks. Groups with the same code will undergo investigation."

By the mid-19th century, Edinburgh was acknowledged as one of the foremost brewing cities in the world, a fact that any proud Scotsman would be honored to flaunt.

Many people are familiar with the pale ale variety called India Pale Ale a.k.a. IPA. This style was originally brewed by the 19th century British brewers for export to their troops stationed in India. Since it had to survive the 6 month trip in the hold of a ship, it contained more alcohol and a lot more hops than a typical Pale Ale. Hops and alcohol helped to prevent spoilage that might have ruined a batch of this precious brew. The Thunder Hop IPA is an American IPA which is an emerging style created by hop loving brewers. It has intense bitterness, flavor and aroma. We chose to use three varieties of American hops in the brewing process. The color is copper to amber, just a bit darker than the Pipe Organ Pale Ale. The aroma is noticeably hoppy due to the use of Sterlings in the dry hop process . You will also pick up a complexity from fruit-like esters. The body is big and malty with some caramel sweetness. You won\\x92t have to wait long for the finish, it comes Thundering in with intense bitterness. '>,\n",

One night he stayed up late with a local gal and went traipsing through the fields. Having nipped a few steins of the local color, he and this gal began playing games. He thought it was best to run and hide in the hopes of whipping up some fright. Quickly he was disoriented in the dark rows and found himself still. A sharp shrill rang out loud and then a groan was felt behind him. He quickly twirled to find Mr. Ouroboros gurgling and drooling in his glowing disgust not ten feet away. Before he could react, he felt the moist fragility of Mr. Ouroboros' carcass gooing all over his body. He said he could feel that body entering him everywhere. The rest remains a blur because that's all he was able to tell those who found him. The girl was never seen again. In the days and weeks after, the boy derailed.

This year instead of more I chose a theme of less. Less as in one grain, one hop and one yeast. I took 110 pounds of grain, 60 gallons of water and created 20 gallons of wort. I then hopped it with Warrior hops to 39 IBUs as I turned 39 this year. Add in champagne yeast and we have a beer. Using an unusual mash technique influenced by pre-industrial English brewing, I did an extended step mash with the grain. Typically a one grain beer like this is pale yellow to golden in color. Due to my mash process the resulting beer is a beautiful golden cherry red with a rich fruity malt flavor.

So, it is with great pride that we crafted this one-time-only imperial IPA. But we‚Äôre Stone‚Ä¶double IPAs flow like water from our brewhouse. So what makes this one unique? Experimental hops! We dabbled with a number of new varietals, including the excitingly named HBC 291, which we brewed with for the very first time. It takes a heaping load of what-the-hell-let‚Äôs-go-for-it attitude to go full-brew with something so new, but fortunately, that‚Äôs something that flows like water around here, too. So enjoy this tribute to the almighty humulus lupulus. Get your nose in that glass and take in the complex assortment of vivid aromatic sensations in the bouquet, followed by flavors that are simultaneously citrus-like, foresty and altogether scrumptious.'>,\n",

Plenty of British Crystal malt in the grist lends this ale its rich colour, its caramel maltiness, and adds the occasional whiff of toffee to the nose.

Balanced up against that giant hop character is a fun little ditty of malt character that oozes sweet orange bread and honey soaked grains. This is our IPA that doesn't need the normal murderers' row of hops, it's doing just fine on its own; it doesn't need buzzwords attached to its style, it's doing just fine on its own. This is simply the IPA we want to be throwing back while we are enjoying the ridiculous Radlands of Northern California we are so insanely lucky to be near.\">,\n",

The maple syrup added to the kettle leaves no sweetness\\x97yeast loves maple syrup, and all it leaves behind is the essence of the maple tree. We also add other herbs and spices to give this stout a distinct floral character. So as you sip this brew we take you back to the edge of the high alpine forest. We use a combination of British pale malt, black patent, chocolate, and roasted barley to give it a complex malt and coffee flavor. In the kettle we use Willamette and Chinook hops. Since this brew starts at a gravity of 1.070 and finishes at about 1.020, we ferment Maple Stout at 20¬∞C for about three weeks to give the yeast ample time to convert the extra sugars and fermentable materials before cellaring at low temperature. Because of the high gravity and complex flavors this brew requires a longer aging process after packaging. We believe that this brew should be matured in the bottle at about 10¬∞ to 12¬∞C for at least two months before consumption. It should be consumed at about 14¬∞C to bring out the subtle flavors.\"'>,\n",

A blend of two different brettanomyces strains with some lactobacillus was added and the barrels sat for one year before blending and bottle conditioning which began in July of of 2016. The high tannin level lends the beer a distinct edge that holds up well against the acidity, and the amount of fruit makes the beer drink much like a cherry wine, a character that is enhanced at cellar temp over typical beer serving temperature.

This is the Church Brew Works version of the national Irish beverage, the Dry Stout, the benchmark of which is Guinness Stout. We did some experimenting and made a Nitro version. What does this mean you ask? Instead of straight CO2 as in most beers, we gassed it with Carbon dioxide and then with Nitrogen. The resulting bubbles contain a mix of the two gasses. Draught Nitro stouts are usually poured through a special faucet that promotes gas breakout. With this in mind, a pint of O'Bryan's Irish Stout will have a black color and a tight tan head that will hold for a much longer period of time. It will go down smooth, and due to a lower dissolved CO2 level in the beer it will not have a prickly bite on your tongue. Notice just after the beer is poured, the bubbles cascade in the glass creating a nice visual. The color is so dark you needn't bother trying to look through it. just have another glass. O'Bryan's Irish Stout has an aroma that is dominated by dark roastiness with little or no hop aroma. The body is perceived as bigger than it actually is due to the creaminess added by the mixed gas dispense. The foremost flavor is dark roasted malt with a bit of a rich caramel note.

This release blends five casks aged on very aromatic nectarines from the 2015 and 2016 harvests. A very ripe aroma gives way to more moderate but complex flavors on the palate, with the fruit and acids never overpowering the rest. This second bottling of Ives finishes refreshingly dry with slight minerality.'>,\n",

No on all counts. We had to use a little creativity and some ingenuity. Think about what flavors are in a porter. Caramel malt sweetness, chocolatly and roasty flavors, and even some notes of dark fruit all these are gleaned from a dark roasted barley malt. So we took out all the dark malt and recreated all the flavors with lighter ingredients. We used a combination of lightly kilned barley, French Avo matte, caramel pilsner and Canadian honey malt to give a caramel malt sweetness.

Unconventionally hopped (65 IBUs)we used both Star B nugget as well as first growth hops from the Albert Einstein Academy program in the mash and with a 75 minute boil we continued to hop generously with Falconers Flight, Nugget, Cascade and Amarillo. We harvested lager yeast from Doug at Gordon Biersch and we bottom fermented cold for 6 weeks. The result was Brainfood a wonderful San Diego Style Zwicklbier.

This year and in the future, it will be a single-hop Simcoe IPA. Since it\\'s technically a different beer, but the soul of it is still the same, we are going to call this H2P going forward. As a former Pitt student, I know the Pitt faithful use HTP and H2P interchangeably, so it seemed fitting to change the \"T\" to a \"2\" for version 2.0. Inspired by the IPAs I fell in love with in California and deepened my college experience in South Oakland, H2P is a 8.0% west coast-style IPA brewed with four kinds of malted barley and a ridiculous amount of Simcoe hops with five kettle additions and two dry hops. The nose of the beer is rich in pine and fruit notes, with hints passion fruit, apricot, along with woodsy and floral undertones. Medium bodied, this beer starts with a mildly bitter taste that gives way to the pine and fruit notes found in the nose on the back end. H2P is a bright and crisp IPA that was designed to be highly drinkable, exceedingly flavorful and aromatic, but without being abrasively bitter.

Rye beers virtually disappeared for almost five hundred years until finally resurfacing in Bavaria around 1988. Rye is now a commonly used ingredient in modern American craft brewing. The addition of rye imparts a somewhat grainy flavor similar to pumpernickel bread, although the rye presence here is quite subtle given the low percentage of malt used in the mash.

Calcium Carbonate is the primary mineral in the composition of Stalactites and Stalagmites, formed over thousands of years as water filters through the earth and drips into caves below the ground. Calcium Carbonate also can be used in brewing to harden water, which ultimately brings out hop character and helps make a clean crisp brew. Stalagmite was brewed with Dutch caramel syrup to bump fermentable sugars in order to boost ABV. While adding subtle caramel notes, this syrup also lightens up the body of the beer (as all of the sugars are fermentable) and lets the Mesquite Powder come forward in the flavor.

The porter style originated in London and was very popular in the 18th and early 19th centuries. With the introduction of pale and mild ales, the popularity of porters decreased. Porter production in England ended in the 1930\\x92s and 1940\\x92s. Smoked malt is made by smoking the barley over a wood fueled fire. Smoky flavors in beer were more common several hundred years ago, when nearly all grain was dried over a wood fueled fire. Alternate methods of drying the malt eliminated the need for wood to be used as a fuel source. Smoked malts are now intentionally smoky, not simply due to the drying procedure. Beechwood was the fuel source for the smoked malt in this recipe. This beer should have a dark reddish brown color. The aroma should be balanced between malty and smoky. The flavor should be chocolaty, toasty, roasty, and smoky. There should be a definite hop bitterness, but the hop aroma should be overshadowed by malt and smoke. The beer should finish with some bitterness and a bit of smoke.'>,\n",

This unusual honey barleywine-esque creation called Brother Adams blew my mind. It was flavorful, lighter in body than I would‚Äôve expected for the high alcohol content, sort of sweet and smooth. I had to know more about braggots and once I did I had to brew my own. My braggot is a spin-off of my barleywine recipe made with a lot of honey. How much honey? Lets just say enough by my tastes. This batch I brewed with Joe Ruotolo of Border Brew Supply fame. I even used his locally sourced, southern New Hampshire honey. The same honey you can buy today at his store if you are so inspired as to create your own braggot. The result is rich, reddish in hue and smooth with a medium full body.

We've sourced indigenous ingredients to make the most authentic interpretation possible: organic pink Peruvian pepper corns, yellow maize and organic Peruvian purple maize. We also use local (US) strawberries - a traditional chicha ingredient that we chose to source locally as we were worried Peruvian strawberries would spoil in transit.The most exotic and unique component of this project, from the perspective of the American beer drinker, happens before the beer is even brewed. As per tradition, instead of germinating all of the grain to release the starches, the purple maize is milled, moistened in the chicha-makers mouths (which we did right here three weeks ago in our Rehoboth brewery), and formed into small cakes which are flattened and laid out to dry. The natural ptyalin enzymes in the saliva act as a catalyst and break the starches into more accessible fermentable sugars. On brewday the muko, or corn cakes, are added to the mash tun pre-boil along with the other grains. This method might sound strange but it is still used regularly today throughout villages in South and Central America. It is actually quite effective and totally sanitary. Since the grain-chewing (known as salivation) happens before the beer is boiled the beer is sterile and free of the wild yeast and bacteria you would find in modern Belgian Lambics. Dogfish Head Chicha is 6.2% ABV, cloudy and unfiltered. It has a beautiful-purple-pink hue from the Peruvian corn, strawberries, and tree seeds - it's dry, fruity, complex, and refreshing.
